# Trade Stock Calculator

This project is based on PyQT5 and using different libraries, stock trade data from the past five years were loaded into it and used to calculate if user had or not profit when selecting specific dates for purchase/selling.

## How to use?

After running the program, simply select the stock trader followed by the quantity and the purchase/selling dates. The app should take both values, access the database and retrieve the difference between purchase and selling cost.
Finally, user should get his profit which would be indicated by a integer in green color. In case of negative values, user should get an integer in red color.
